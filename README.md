# Statistical-Crowd-Counting
#### Implemented the project using PostgreSQL as a database, Django as a server-side framework,  and Html, CSS, bootstrap as a frontend technology. The Deep Learning model was used to predict crowd count from video frames. The project provides area-wise statistical analysis of crowd flow throughout the shops, malls,  etc. 

#### Dataset used to train Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural network Deep Learning model is Shangaitech part A dataset. 
#### Link for the Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/tthien/shanghaitech

## Project Details:

### Deep Learning model defination and prediction code is int mscnn/views.py file

### Register Area:
#### The registeration process allows you to enter number of areas present in the shop.
